# Vision: Arena Combat Engine

## The Core Concept

**"A tabletop game that came to life."**

This is not a realistic racing simulator. This is not an arcade shooter. This is the experience of playing a classic vehicular combat tabletop game with your friends - but the miniatures move on their own, the dice roll themselves, and the explosions are real.

## Visual Identity

### The Book Art Feel (DECISION)

The visual style should evoke classic 80s tabletop game books and magazines - not a literal tabletop, but that distinctive illustrated aesthetic.

**Key direction:**
- Technical illustration quality - detailed but stylized
- Gritty 80s post-apocalyptic, not grimdark or cartoony
- **NOT** trying to look like a game board on a table
- **IS** trying to capture the feel of book art come to life

Elements:
- **Vehicles** have that illustrated quality - bold colors, visible wear, chunky proportions
- **The Arena** feels industrial and lived-in
- **The Grid** is visible but integrated (painted lines on concrete, not glowing overlay)
- **UI** uses the record sheet aesthetic, typewriter fonts, stamped text

### The 3D Reality

But this tabletop has come alive:

- Vehicles have **real physics** - they skid, roll, tumble when hit hard
- **Fire and smoke** billow from damaged cars - tangible, not particle-spam
- **Metal deforms**, paint scratches, wheels blow out
- **Shadows and lighting** give depth and drama
- When a car explodes, debris scatters across the board

### The Hybrid Aesthetic

```
NOT THIS:                          THIS:
────────────────                   ────────────────
Hyper-realistic                    Stylized but solid
Photo-real cars                    Miniature/model feel
Video game HUD                     Tabletop information display
Generic post-apocalypse            Distinctive world with personality
```

## Reference Points

### Games to Study

| Game | What to Take |
|------|--------------|
| **Tabletop Simulator** | Physical objects on a table, camera perspective |
| **Inscryption** | Paper/cardboard aesthetic that feels alive and dangerous |
| **Wartales / Battle Brothers** | Miniature figurine feel, tactical weight |
| **Hand of Fate** | Cards and tabletop but cinematic presentation |
| **Into the Breach** | Clean tactical grid, readable but stylish |
| **XCOM** | Turn resolution drama, camera follows action |

### Visual Language

Classic tabletop vehicular combat has a specific visual language:

- Gritty but not grimdark cover art
- Vehicle counters - top-down, detailed silhouettes
- Arena maps - clean grids, industrial structures
- Technical illustration style for equipment catalogs
- Action scenes with 80s sci-fi aesthetic

This isn't Mad Max chrome-and-leather. It's working-class America with guns on cars.

## Color Palette (Direction)

| Element | Feel |
|---------|------|
| **Arena floor** | Concrete grey, worn asphalt, oil stains |
| **Arena walls** | Industrial - corrugated metal, concrete barriers |
| **Vehicles** | Bold primary colors (team identification) with weathering |
| **Fire/Explosions** | Orange-yellow, reads clearly against grey |
| **UI elements** | Paper/cardboard tan, typewriter fonts, stamped text |
| **Grid lines** | Subtle - painted lines or scored concrete |

---

## Audio Direction (Future)

- **Engine sounds** that feel mechanical, not synthetic
- **Weapons** with punch - machine guns rattle, rockets whoosh then boom
- **Metal impacts** - crashes should feel heavy
- **Ambient** - arena crowd murmur, announcer echoes
- **Music** - 80s synth? Industrial? Country-western irony? (TBD)

## The Nostalgia Factor

Fans of classic tabletop vehicular combat remember:

- Photocopying vehicle record sheets
- Arguing about line-of-sight
- The smell of the pocket box
- Calculating build points by hand

The game should occasionally wink at this:

- Vehicle record sheets as UI elements
- Turn phases announced like the rulebook describes them
- Easter eggs referencing the genre

### Dice Rolls (DECISION)

Dice should appear during damage resolution - players love seeing the roll.

**Balance:**
- Show dice briefly during combat phase
- Don't slow down gameplay for dice animations
- Optional: "fast mode" skips dice visualization
- Dice aesthetic: Classic red/white pips, maybe slightly worn

The roll should feel satisfying without becoming a bottleneck.

## What We're NOT Building

- A Twisted Metal clone (arcade action)
- A Crossout clone (F2P MMO grind)
- A realistic driving sim
- A generic post-apocalypse game
- A mobile-first casual game

---

## Success Criteria

The visual design succeeds if:

1. A fan of tabletop vehicular combat sees a screenshot and feels at home
2. A new player understands it's a tactical game, not a twitch shooter
3. The board-game heritage is obvious but not limiting
4. Watching a car explode feels satisfying every single time
5. The aesthetic is distinctive enough to be recognizable

## Open Questions

- [ ] How literal is the "tabletop" frame? (Table edges visible? Dice on screen?)
- [ ] Vehicle art style: Painted miniatures vs. cardboard standees vs. stylized 3D?
- [ ] Arena style: Indoor arena vs. outdoor lot vs. both?
- [ ] UI: Fully diegetic (part of game world) vs. traditional overlay?
- [ ] How much vehicle customization visible? (Paint, decals, damage wear)
